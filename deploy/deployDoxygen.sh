# Preconditions:
# - Packages doxygen doxygen-doc doxygen-latex doxygen-gui graphviz
#   must be installed to create Doxygen files.
# - A gh-pages branch should already exist. See below for more info on how to
#   create a gh-pages branch.
#
# Required global variables:
# - TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER : The number of the current build.
# - TRAVIS_COMMIT       : The commit that the current build is testing.
# - GH_REPO_NAME        : The name of the repository.
# - GH_REPO_REF         : The GitHub reference to the repository.
# - GH_REPO_TOKEN       : Secure token to the github repository.

# Set the push default to simple i.e. push only the current branch.
# git config --global push.default simple
# Pretend to be a user called Travis CI.
# git config user.name "Travis CI"
# git config user.email "travis@travis-ci.org"

# Remove everything currently in the gh-pages doxygen folder.
# gitHub is smart enough to know which files have changed ans which files have
# stayed the same and will only update the changed files. So the gh-pages branch
# can be safely cleaned, and it is sure that everything pushed later is the new
# documentation

##### Upload the documentation to the gh-pages branch
# Only upload if Doxygen successfully created the documentation.
# Check this by verifying that the html directory and the file html/index.html
# both exist. This is a good indication that Doxygen did it's work.
